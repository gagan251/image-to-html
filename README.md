# Image → HTML Generator (No Storage)

A tiny static site (HTML/CSS/JS) that lets you:
1. Select an image from your computer
2. Preview it
3. Download a generated `image-page.html` that embeds the image inside it (base64)

✅ No Firebase Storage needed  
✅ Works on GitHub Pages / any static hosting  
⚠️ The generated page is for personal/offline use because it embeds the image data in the HTML file.

## Run locally
Just open `index.html` in your browser.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Create a GitHub repo
2. Upload these files
3. Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → select `main` and `/root`
4. Open the Pages URL
